        "description": "when i just arrived in Germany, i joined an international school that offered 4 levels of German: D4 (beginners), D3B, D3A, D2 (fluent) and D1 (native). the normal progression from D4 was to advance a level per year, until either D3A or D2 in best cases. D2 was mostly inhabited by kids that grew up in Germany with foreign parents. i went from D4 to D2 within one year. after that success, i made it my goal to make it to D1, which was considered absurd. Despite the discouragement, i managed to join D1 after another year, in grade 9. though i was very proud of the achievement, it turned to be a mistake. i did not enjoy the class and should have just chilled in D2. eventually, i asked to be moved back to D2. nonetheless, i count it as a sucesss.",

Prof. Naumann was impressed and decided to co-publish and name the central function used after my name. before publishing, for due diligence, Prof. Naumann checked whether this proof was really novel. it was not; the exact same proof had been published in the 1970s and he had just not heard about it before. that made my proof not novel but still counts as independent research.",
